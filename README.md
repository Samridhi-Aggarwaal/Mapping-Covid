# Mapping-Covid

This application provides a visual representation of COVID-19 data on an interactive world map, allowing users to explore the pandemic's impact by location. Using Mapbox for map rendering, the app dynamically displays various metrics for each region, such as infection counts, recoveries, fatalities, and active cases. The application fetches data from a structured JSON file that includes details on each locationâ€™s population, geographical coordinates, and the most recent COVID-19 statistics, ensuring users can view updated pandemic trends.
